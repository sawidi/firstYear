          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>My name is Mohamed Alsawidi. This website is a summary of my small trip to London, a city I have dreamt of going to since I was a child. Going from looking at videos of people vlogging in London to finally walking through the city myself, a sudden feeling got to me, a feeling of pure joy and excitement I haven’t ever experienced. It was honestly hard to articulate that feeling of going somewhere Ive always dreamt of.</p>
          <p>London has a unique blend of vintage and modern landmarks which complement each other. I will talk about the main landmarks I was lucky to see when I was in London for 2 days.</p>

          <p>Before I jump into the main part of this project, I want to talk what i mainly used to move around London. The Tube is famed to be one of the best and sophisticated train systems in the world. The first ideas for the underground was first opened in 1862 to find a solution for street congestion, which was first owned by different companies. Tunnelling safety has been achieved in 1870, but the tunnels couldn’t be used until the late 1880s, when electric power was first used along with lifts. The Tube that we know as today was then merged from the different companies that owned several stations and trains and opened in the early 1900s.</p>
