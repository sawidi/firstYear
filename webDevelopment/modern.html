          <h2>Modern Landmarks</h2>
          <p>Today London has evolved into a global metropolis, serving as a cultural, financial, and political capital. From the post-war reconstruction that followed the devastation of World War II to the present day, the city has undergone changes while retaining its historical charm. The city has embraced diversity, becoming a melting pot of cultures and ideas. London stands as a testament to the harmonious coexistence of its rich history and contemporary aspirations.</p>

        <div class = "title2">
          <h2>20 Fenchurch Street</h2>
          <img src ="images/fenchurch.jpg" alt = "">
          <p>Another building that caught my eyes was 20 Fenchurch Street, nicknamed the Walkie Talkie building. It is a uniquely shaped sky scraper hovering over London’s skies with its curved reflective glass. The building contains office space, restaurants, and a public garden on the rooftop, called the Sky Garden, from which you can view the city from atop. The nickname was coined to the city because of its shape, resembling a usual walkie talkie.</p>

        <div class = "title2">
          <h2>London Eye</h2>
          <img src ="images/LondonEye.jpg" alt = "">
          <p>The London Eye, built in 1998, is a giant Ferris wheel in the heart of London. Standing at a height of 135 meters, It's a massive, iconic structure on the South Bank of the River Thames. The London Eye offers panoramic views of the cityscape. It's a major tourist hotspot and a fun way to soak in the city’s beauty. The London Eye lights up at night, as you can see in the picture, which gives it a nice aesthetic.</p>

        <div class = "title2">
          <h2>The Shard</h2>
          <img src ="images/shard.jpg" alt = "">
          <p>Next is The Shard, which is the is the tallest skyscraper in London. When I was walking around in the city in the first day, I couldn’t help but look at it and appreciate its architecture. Officially known as The Shard of Glass, it was completed in 2012 and designed by architect Renzo Piano. The building reaches a height of 310 meters and is 87 floors tall. Its glass shape gives it a sleek and modern appearance.</p>
